## Game Overview

You start with 1 world.

Enemy will start with 1 world.

Send your mages to other worlds to capture them. Do this by tapping a world to highlight it, then tapping the world you wish to send a mage. OR long press on the target world to send a group of mages.

Each world that you control will gain a mage every so often, but so will the enemies.
